# AITalents-Sonean-Briefer
Hi there! This is the final version of our AITalents project! This is the code to run to the project and in order to get it running, you open it up and run app.py! The username is User and the password is Pass. There won't be anything viewable as the private SONEAN data has been taken off. This is custom built for SONEAN and as such, the data will only be accessible per their permissions. You can insert any other spreadsheet to view the results. The map may be unaccessible at the time due to the same concerns about privacy. For a more in depth look at the project, please ask the team in order to request to view a fully functional model!
